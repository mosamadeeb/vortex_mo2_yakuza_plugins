# Yakuza Games Support Plugins
Plugins for Yakuza game series to add support for [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) and [Mod Organizer](https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/modorganizer).

***

# Requirements

[RyuModManager](https://github.com/SutandoTsukai181/RyuModManager/releases/latest) (v2.0+) has to be installed to the game directory and ran at least once.

***

# Installing

## Mod Organizer
Download the plugins from the [releases](https://github.com/SutandoTsukai181/vortex_mo2_yakuza_plugins/releases) tab and follow the instructions there.

## Vortex
Check each plugin's **Installing** section on its own Nexus page. If Vortex says the extension "has not been approved" yet, then you can do a manual download from Nexus and drag the file over to the extensions tab in Vortex.

# Usage 

You can now use the **Mod Manager Download** option when downloading mods. All mods that mention **Ryu Mod Manager** (or **RMM**) in their description should be compatible with the plugins. If a mod does not have that option, then you can still download it manually and drag its file to the mods tab in Vortex, or install it as a zip in Mod Organizer.

Ryu Mod Manager has to be run before launching the game whenever you install/enable/disable any mods. By default, this is done automatically. If you want to disable this for some reason and run it manually, you can disable the *RebuildMLO* option in `YakuzaParless.ini`, which is generated by Ryu Mod Manager in the game directory.

## Mod Organizer

Create a new game instance and choose the Yakuza game you want to mod. If you had some mods installed in your Ryu Mod Manager `/mods/` folder, you will get an option to import them into Mod Organizer. They will be imported according to their load order as defined by Ryu Mod Manager.

## Vortex

Vortex will show an error if the mod that was downloaded is not supported/has an invalid format. In that case, you can either install it manually or ask the mod author to reupload the mod with RMM support.

You can even convert an unsupported mod yourself, by following [these instructions](https://github.com/SutandoTsukai181/RyuModManager/wiki/Creating-A-New-Mod). All it requires is some basic understanding of the game's data directory layout (which you can get by reading the instructions). After repackaging the mod, you can install it to Vortex manually by dragging it to the mods tab in Vortex.

# Credits

The Vortex extension was mostly based on the tutorial extension from [here](https://modding.wiki/en/vortex/developer/create-a-game-extension) and the Subnautica extension, so huge thanks to their authors.
